## Key Takeaways — Applied AI Research in Medical Image Analysis

**Applied AI Research in Medical Image Analysis**

* Medical image analysis using AI must address real-world constraints such as limited data access, privacy regulations, and the need for clinical trust, not just model accuracy.

* Public medical datasets play a crucial role in applied research because accessing hospital data is often difficult due to legal and ethical restrictions.

* Image preprocessing is not a minor step; carefully chosen techniques can significantly improve model performance and stability, as seen in ischemic stroke classification.

* Explainable AI (XAI) is essential in medical applications to ensure clinicians can understand and trust model predictions, especially in high-risk decision-making.

* CT scans remain clinically important despite MRI being more detailed, because CT is faster and more practical in emergency medical situations.

* Medical AI is moving beyond simple classification toward predictive and prognostic modeling, such as forecasting future cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease.

* Multitask learning frameworks benefit from clinically informed weighting strategies, showing that not all clinical variables contribute equally to prediction quality.

* Federated learning provides a practical solution to data privacy challenges by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw patient data.

* Privacy-preserving approaches like federated learning can achieve performance comparable to or better than centralized models.

* Single-label classification is often insufficient in clinical practice, where patients may have multiple coexisting conditions.

* Explainability techniques such as Grad-CAM must be adapted to handle multi-label medical problems rather than applied directly without modification.

* Overall, applied medical AI research is evolving toward systems that are more realistic, interpretable, privacy-aware, and aligned with clinical workflows.
