## Key Takeaways — Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Data Augmentation

* Data scarcity is one of the biggest limitations in medical imaging AI due to high acquisition costs, annotation effort, and privacy constraints.

* GANs provide a way to synthetically generate medical images that resemble real data, helping expand small and imbalanced datasets.

* The generator–discriminator framework allows GANs to learn complex data distributions through adversarial training rather than explicit supervision.

* GAN-based data augmentation is especially useful in medical imaging, where collecting large, diverse datasets is often impractical.

* The quality of synthetic images produced by GANs depends heavily on training stability, dataset size, and hyperparameter tuning.

* Simple GAN implementations are valuable for learning purposes but may generate low-quality samples if not carefully trained.

* Synthetic data can improve model robustness when generated correctly, but poor-quality synthetic data may harm performance.

* GAN-based augmentation does not inherently cause overfitting; overfitting must be controlled using standard training strategies.

* A major unresolved challenge is ensuring that GAN-generated images preserve true biological and pathological meaning, not just visual similarity.

* GANs should be treated as an experimental and supportive tool rather than a replacement for real clinical data.

* Careful validation is required before using GAN-generated data in safety-critical medical applications.

* GANs are best viewed as a complementary technique that supports model development under data-limited conditions.
