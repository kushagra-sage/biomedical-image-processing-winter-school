## Key Takeaways — Deep Learning for Biomedical Signals and Medical Imaging

Trust is the central requirement for deploying AI in clinical environments, as high accuracy alone is insufficient if clinicians do not feel confident using the system in real decision-making scenarios.

Medical AI operates in high-risk settings where errors are asymmetric, and false negatives often carry far more severe clinical consequences than false positives, directly influencing model design and evaluation.

Trustworthy clinical AI systems must satisfy three non-negotiable pillars: lawful compliance with regulations, ethical behavior that avoids bias and discrimination, and robustness against noise, variability, and real-world data imperfections.

Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for clinical adoption because it enables transparency, supports human oversight, and allows clinicians to critically evaluate and validate AI recommendations rather than blindly accepting them.

Human-in-the-loop workflows are fundamental to clinical AI, ensuring that AI systems augment human expertise instead of replacing clinicians, with final responsibility always remaining with the human decision-maker.

In radiology, AI systems such as gaze-support tools can reduce perceptual errors and fatigue by guiding attention rather than providing diagnoses, thereby improving safety without undermining clinician autonomy.

Domain shift is a major challenge in medical imaging AI, as models trained on one dataset can fail dramatically when exposed to new clinical data, highlighting the limits of dataset-specific accuracy.

Automated neural architecture design using genetic algorithms can improve robustness by reducing manual design bias, but this approach is computationally expensive and must be carefully aligned with clinical objectives.

In biomedical time-series analysis, anomaly detection models trained on healthy patterns can effectively identify pathological events by detecting deviations, offering both detection and interpretability.

Localization of anomalies within signals enhances explainability by showing clinicians where abnormal behavior occurs, transforming AI outputs from simple labels into actionable clinical evidence.

White-box models offer transparency and ease of validation but limited predictive power, while black-box deep learning models provide higher accuracy at the cost of interpretability and regulatory complexity.

Global explanations help audit and validate AI systems at an institutional level, whereas local explanations are critical at the bedside to justify individual patient-specific decisions.

The future of clinical AI lies in human-centered design, where trust, explainability, robustness, and clinician collaboration are treated as core system requirements rather than optional enhancements.
