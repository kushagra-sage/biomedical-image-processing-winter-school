## Key Takeaways — Real-time NCV Interpretation using Machine Learning

* Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS/NCV) are essential for diagnosing peripheral neuropathies, but traditional interpretation is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and prone to inter-observer variability. 

* Manual NCV reporting can take 30–45 minutes for a test that is performed in about 15 minutes, creating workflow inefficiencies and clinical bottlenecks. 

* Increasing patient load, particularly due to the rising prevalence of diabetes, necessitates automated and scalable solutions for NCV interpretation. 

* Machine learning enables a shift from manual interpretation to real-time, automated analysis, supporting what is described as “augmented intelligence” rather than replacement of clinicians. 

* An ML-based NCV workflow includes signal acquisition and preprocessing, automated feature extraction using CNNs, intelligent classification, and real-time report generation with physician validation. 

* AI-based reporting reduces interpretation time to under one minute while producing highly consistent and reproducible results compared to traditional methods. 

* The “inspire” multimodal AI model represents a significant advancement by integrating NCV signal data with clinical context such as symptoms and medical history. 

* Incorporating multimodal data improves diagnostic accuracy, with the “inspire” model achieving approximately 92% accuracy in distinguishing normal from abnormal NCV results. 

* The iigers Score provides a transparent confidence metric for AI-generated reports, helping clinicians decide when outputs are reliable or require manual review. 

* Validation through a randomized controlled trial demonstrated that the AI model performs competitively with, and in some cases better than, physician-only interpretation. 

* Future directions include real-time procedural guidance during NCV acquisition, deeper multimodal integration with imaging modalities, and predictive phenotyping for prognosis. 

* Despite strong performance, challenges such as automation bias, data quality issues, ethical responsibility, and the need for human oversight remain critical. 

* The overarching vision is to treat AI as a “digital resident” that performs heavy analytical tasks while clinicians retain final authority and responsibility.
