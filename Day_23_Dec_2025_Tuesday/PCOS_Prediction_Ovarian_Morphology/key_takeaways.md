## Key Takeaways — Ovarian Morphology and Doppler Indices in PCOS

* PCOS is a complex endocrine and metabolic disorder with increasing prevalence due to modern lifestyle factors, making it a major public health concern.

* Hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance are the core drivers of PCOS and are responsible for its reproductive and metabolic manifestations.

* The Rotterdam criteria emphasize the critical role of ultrasound imaging in diagnosing and characterizing PCOS.

* Characteristic ovarian morphology, including increased follicle count, enlarged ovarian volume, and stromal changes, provides essential diagnostic evidence.

* Ovarian artery Doppler indices such as PI and RI offer valuable insight into altered ovarian blood flow and stromal vascularity in PCOS.

* Lower PI and RI values in PCOS patients reflect increased blood flow and are associated with insulin resistance and metabolic risk.

* Ultrasound findings can help predict fertility outcomes, treatment response, and miscarriage risk in women with PCOS.

* Imaging biomarkers also serve as early indicators of long-term metabolic complications such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

* AI has the potential to reduce operator variability in ultrasound interpretation and standardize PCOS diagnosis.

* Integrating imaging, hormonal, and metabolic data using AI can enable more accurate risk stratification and personalized treatment planning.

* There is no definitive cure for PCOS, making lifestyle modification and early diagnosis central to long-term management.

* Public awareness, preventive strategies, and early screening are essential to mitigate the rising burden of PCOS and its complications.
