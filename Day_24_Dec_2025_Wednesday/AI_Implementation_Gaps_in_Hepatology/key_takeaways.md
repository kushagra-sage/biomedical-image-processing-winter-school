## Key Takeaways — AI Implementation in Hepatology

* Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) is a rapidly growing public health problem in India, with a disease burden now comparable to that of developed countries.

* The major contributors to liver disease include cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, chronic hepatitis B and C infections, and liver cancer, all of which contribute to high morbidity, mortality, and economic burden.

* Mortality from cirrhosis and liver cancer has continued to rise over the last 15 years, reflecting a broader shift from infectious diseases to non-communicable diseases.

* Liver disease progresses slowly and silently, with a long asymptomatic phase during fibrosis and compensated cirrhosis, making early clinical detection difficult.

* Once liver disease progresses to decompensated cirrhosis, survival drops sharply to less than two years, and liver transplantation becomes the only curative option.

* The long silent phase of CLD represents a critical opportunity for AI-based early detection and intervention.

* Traditional diagnostic methods are either inaccurate (simple tests) or expensive and inaccessible (advanced tools like FibroScan and biopsy).

* AI models improve early detection by integrating multiple data sources, including clinical parameters, laboratory tests, and imaging data.

* AI can detect subtle trends and variations in routine data, such as small changes in CBC parameters, that may be missed by clinicians.

* Validation of AI models against gold standards such as liver biopsy and FibroScan is essential to ensure clinical reliability.

* The Mayo Clinic ACE Score demonstrates that AI can identify cirrhosis using low-cost, widely available ECG data, enabling scalable population-level screening.

* AI supports precision medicine by predicting which patients are likely to benefit from specific treatments and which may experience harm.

* In alcohol-associated hepatitis, AI can help distinguish steroid responders from non-responders, reducing unnecessary exposure to harmful treatments.

* In liver cancer, AI enables prediction of treatment response, toxicity risk, and non-response, allowing safer and more targeted therapy decisions.

* Overall, AI in hepatology serves as a clinical decision-support tool that enhances early diagnosis, enables personalized treatment, and addresses unmet clinical and technical needs in liver disease management.
