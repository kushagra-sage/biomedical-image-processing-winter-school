# Biomedical Image Processing – Winter School

## Overview

This repository documents my **day-wise and sub-topic–wise learnings** from the
**Winter School on Biomedical Image Processing and Its Applications**.

The winter school brought together **academic researchers and medical practitioners** to discuss theoretical foundations, practical challenges, and emerging research directions in biomedical image analysis using **AI, machine learning, and deep learning techniques**.

This repository is intended as a **structured academic record of learning**, focusing on understanding concepts, reflecting on clinical relevance, and performing **small exploratory hands-on experiments** where the session content naturally allowed it.

---

## Repository Organization

The repository follows a **strict day-wise structure**, aligned with the official winter school schedule.

Each day folder is further divided into **sub-topic (session) folders**, reflecting the actual sessions conducted on that day.

Each sub-topic folder contains:

* `notes.md` – conceptual understanding written in my own words
* `key_takeaways.md` – important insights and learning points
* `tiny_hands_on.ipynb` – *optional*, included only for technically hands-on sessions

This organization ensures:

* Coverage of **all sessions**
* Deeper exploration only where **technically appropriate**
* No forced or artificial experimentation

---

## Hands-On Work Philosophy

Hands-on work included in this repository is:

* **Exploratory in nature**
* Focused on applying **concepts discussed during sessions**
* Limited in scope to avoid over-claiming results

The notebooks:

* Do **not** claim clinical accuracy
* Are **not** intended for deployment
* Are created strictly for learning and experimentation

Not all sessions are suitable for hands-on implementation, and this distinction is intentionally preserved.

---

## Learning Philosophy

This repository prioritizes:

* Understanding over completeness
* Reflection over performance metrics
* Clinical relevance over algorithmic novelty

It represents a **learning journey**, not a finalized research or production-ready system.

---

## Disclaimer

All content in this repository is created **solely for academic learning and documentation purposes**.

* The experiments are **not clinically validated**
* The results should **not be used for diagnosis or treatment**
* Any datasets or examples used are for **educational exploration only**

## Acknowledgement

I sincerely thank **Dr. Satya Ranjan Dash**,
**Dean, School of Computer Application, KIIT**, for organizing the *Winter School on Biomedical Image Processing and Its Applications* and for enabling an interdisciplinary platform that brought together experts from academia and medicine.

I am also grateful to all the doctors, clinicians, and researchers who delivered sessions during the winter school and shared their expertise, clinical insights, and real-world perspectives on biomedical image analysis and AI-driven healthcare.

---

## Final Note

This repository reflects a **structured and sincere effort** to document learning from the winter school by organizing concepts, reflecting on limitations, and selectively experimenting with technical ideas.

It is intended to evolve as understanding deepens and should be viewed as an **ongoing academic learning record**.
